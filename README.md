# COVID-19 Spread Prediction: Leveraging Machine Learning for Accurate Forecasting
The project aims to predict the widespread of COVID-19 in various countries worldwide by leveraging different machine learning models. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, it has become crucial to understand the symptoms, study the patterns of affected individuals, and generate meaningful statistics. Accurate predictions of future virus outbreaks can greatly assist healthcare services and hospitals in preparing the necessary resources, such as medications, beds, and care units.

The study utilizes various machine learning techniques, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, as well as other models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and ARIMA. By analyzing historical data and employing trend prediction methodologies, the project aims to identify the best fitting model for predicting the spread of COVID-19 across different countries.
